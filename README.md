#### Milestone 1 Team Workflow

**The team workflow is a document, including:** 

• **Team name:** Figures out one unique name.

• **Roles:** Outlines team roles and responsibilities. 

• **Strategies:** 

Gives us information about strategy for project management, 

e.g., team meeting times (weekly meeting, who will arrange the meeting 

and record meeting minutes)

• **Plan:** 

Makes timeline for each milestone, making sure that buffers are 

included in your plan and at least two iterations are scheduled for each 

milestone.

The main purpose of this document is to give you some rules for team 

process, management, tracking, and goal setting. 


*To Commit: use `git cz` instead of `git commit` to enjoy something fun~*
